I have a strong pass for video production, music production, song writing a graphics design. I’ve had the pleasure of sharing the stage with artists including Illenium, Adventure Club, and Krewella. In many of my songs, you’ll find that I add a “live instrument” aspect to breathe new life into electronic music. I also specialize in transforming classical pieces from icons such as Beethoven and Vivaldi into modernized rock/metal arrangements.","viewCount":862728,"lengthSeconds":204,"watchProgress":201.975078,"timeWatched":1625465491860,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"0geExW1u5lVhl6eR"}

She’d text you frequently but when you ask her to hang out with you suddenly she’s busy. What went wrong? I hear you.

The video showed four young women singing and clapping in a room as two young men danced to the music. The village elders saw the celebration as a blatant defiance of strict tribal customs that separate men and women at gatherings, and a decree was issued for those in the video and their families to be killed as their actions were deemed 'dishonorable.' \n\nThe women and one of their sisters, aged just 12, were allegedly imprisoned for a month and tortured before being killed. The men went into hiding but three of their brothers were shot dead.\n\nEvery year, nearly a thousand people are known to be killed in the name of honor in Pakistan. Many more go unreported, considered a part of everyday life — but the killings in Kohistan became national news after the surviving brother of the victims made it his mission to seek justice. VICE News host Hani Taha travels to Pakistan to meet Afzal Kohistani to investigate one of the country's most perplexing honor killing cases, three years on. \n\nProduced by Academy Award and Emmy Award-winning documentary filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, VICE News finds out some of the grimmest truths about the pervasive culture of so-called honor killings in the region.\n\nThis video was originally published on VICE in 2016.\n\nClick here to SUBSCRIBE to VICE Asia: https://bit.ly/2LhqAR9","viewCount":2958868,"lengthSeconds":1261,"watchProgress":0,"timeWatched":1625475354128,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"EwlZah3EK6uppg6k"}

In October 2020, Pakistan Telecommunication Agency banned TikTok due to \"immoral and indecent content\".\n\nTikTok stars launched a Twitterstorm with the hashtag #UnbanTiktok, and within 10 days the ban was lifted. We will hear the real stories of these TikTokers and how TikTok stardom is not merely a hobby but also a source of income. The film explores these unlikely young people’s rise to fame; their income from TikTok; the adversity they faced for their unconventional online personas; how the ban initially affected them.\n\r\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\r\n\r\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\r\n\r\nFollow VICE News here:\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\r\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\r\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\r\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\r\n\r\n#VICENews #News","viewCount":730392,"lengthSeconds":634,"watchProgress":626.351346,"timeWatched":1625749913913,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"JM4Oh9m8OjKVz9py"}

This inexplicable delay in a high - profile case and the shocking treatment meted out to the accused - is now putting India in the international spotlight. Uncomfortable questions are being asked about our Human Rights record and the defence even claiming that evidence was planted against the arrested social activists and intellectuals. \n\nWith #StanSwamy perishing in custody the BK16 accused have been reduced to BK15 - will the govt risk more accused passing away - does the Govt not want the truth about these #UrbanNaxals to come out ??? - why is the Govt allowing agencies to drag their feet over this matter???

Tracing the contours of her career, she calls for more authentic representation of different cultures in media -- and a shift in how we tell our stories. \"Presence creates possibility,\" she says. \"Who we see thriving in the world teaches us how to see ourselves, how to think about our own value, how to dream about our futures.\"\n\nThe TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

No, its not some automation script. You will still experience the whole gentoo install, just with much less headaches.\n\nLike if you enjoyed the video, comment if you have any questions!\n\nFind me elsewhere:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kamiyaa91/\nGithub: https://github.com/kamiyaa/\n\nThis video is not a complete install guide, but rather a video on how to make the install easier, simpler, faster, more streamlined, etc.\n\nI start using Gentoo back in 2014. At the time, I had 0 experience with Linux and was mostly looking for an alternative to Windows.\nOne of my friends introduced to me to Linux and told me to install Gentoo. I fell for the meme and went ahead and installed Gentoo.\n\nWhen it comes to install Gentoo, I believe there are 3 major problems that people run into:\n\n1. Partitioning\nMost tutorials install on a virtual machine, so the partitioning is very rudimentary. Most likely, you'll be installing it on bare metal hardware with setups like Dualbooting or separate /home partitions.\n\n2. Internet Connectivity\nAgain, most install tutorials use a virtual machine so internet is not an issue. But the Gentoo install media does not come with binary blobs required to get wifi working. So if you are installing it on a laptop, you will need to find an ethernet cable. But some laptops do not even come with ethernet ports.\n\n3. The Need For Another Device\nBecause the Gentoo media is very minimal, you will need another device, such as your phone or laptop, to read the handbook. And this workflow is not very efficient. You have to use a small screen, you can't copy/paste command, etc.\n\nThe new way I learned to install Gentoo is to not use the Gentoo install media, but to use a Ubuntu install media instead.\n\nFull Disclaimer: I did not come up with this idea.\n\nUbuntu comes with binary blobs so internet is not a pain to set up.\nIt also has a graphical user interface so you can use Firefox to open the Gentoo handbook.\nIt also comes with gparted installed for all your partitioning needs.\n\nMusic:\nImagine by lukrembo\nMichikusa by PeriTune (Licensed under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)","viewCount":25948,"lengthSeconds":610,"watchProgress":609.918547,"timeWatched":1626080092012,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"YrqOzOiHbMqpl9S4"}

After a childhood he remembers fondly, his life changed dramatically in August 1947. \n\nAs Britain left the Indian subcontinent, colonial planners hastily split it into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.\n\nKhanna was forced to join one of the largest migrations in human history, as sectarian violence erupted and millions fled in both directions to save their lives.\n\nHe has dreamed of going back ever since and, after trying for several years, Khanna finally obtained a visa to return to Pakistan.\n\nDespite deep tensions, he's determined to show that people in the neighbouring nations still have much more in common than that which divides them.\n\nMore from Witness on: YouTube - http://aje.io/witnessYT \nFacebook - https://facebook.com/AJWitness\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/AJWitness \nInstagram - https://instagram.com/ajwitness/ \nWebsite - http://aljazeera.com/witness","viewCount":4013541,"lengthSeconds":1506,"watchProgress":1292.847483,"timeWatched":1625751308120,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"dXd6UzZ8lubxgJI0"}

It comes with a new interface style, some redesigned apps, and a few features that I think we could make use of on our Linux desktops. There are also a few things that we've been doing for years and that Microsoft is catching up to, and I think it's going to be interesting to compare both implementations.\n\nBecome a channel member to get access to a weekly patroncast and vote on the next topics I'll cover:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5UAwBUum7CPN5buc-_N1Fw/join\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/thelinuxexperiment\n\nFollow me on Twitter : http://twitter.com/thelinuxEXP\n\nMy Gaming on Linux Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaw_Lz7oifDb-PZCAcZ07kw\n\nFollow me on ODYSEE: https://odysee.com/@TheLinuxExperiment:e\nOr join ODYSEE: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@TheLinuxExperiment:e\n\nJoin us on Discord: https://discord.gg/nN8wwZPpwr\n\nThe Linux Experiment merch: get your goodies there! https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/the-linux-experiment\n\n\n00:00 Intro\n01:24 Android App Support\n03:56 Tiling\n06:15 Gaming\n07:49 The bad stuff\n\nOk, now let's start with the feature that caught my eye the most: Windows 11 will be able to run Android apps, out of the box.\nNow wether you have a use for that or not will determine how interested you are in this, but it still opens up a TON of possibilities, especially for mobile hardware.\n\nOf course, Microsoft chose a debatable course of action by using the Amazon App Store as its Android app library, and you will have to create an amazon account, but Android apps will run through a similar subsystem to WSL, which means that performance shouldn't be horrible at all.\n\nThis is a feature I wish our Linux desktops did, or at least did better. You can use Anbox on Linux, to try and run Android apps, but it's a clunky solution, based on an old Android version. It doesn't come with an appstore, so you have to sideload apps, and it's not integrated with the system at all.\n\nI think we could do something similar than what microsoft is doing, but better.\nFirst, of course, you use F Droid. \n\nSecond, Integrate android apps in the menu, docks, panels, whatever our desktops use\n\nThird, integrate android apps in our various app stores, to let users download and run them in one click.\n\nFourth, we can use the Android Open Source Projet, and de-google it, to use as a base: all the advantages of Android, without the spyware.\n\n\nThe second feature I found interesting is the tiling.\nYeah, sure Microsoft has conveniently forgotten than we've been doing this and more for ages.\nTiling WMs have been a thing for ages on Linux, PopOS has its auto tiling feature, and most desktops allow users to snap windows to any side or corner of the screen easily.\n\nBUT\n\nMicrosoft has, in my opinion, done it in a more clever, user friendly way than any of these solutions.\n\nFirst, their solution is discoverable. You just need to hover over the maximize button, which is something you're going to do a lot, as soon as you want to maximize a window.\n\nSecond, they offer pre-made layouts, so you can get a feel of what you can do with this feature: just by looking at the popup, you can see that windows could be arranged in various configurations, and that can give you ideas if you've never thought about organizing your windows.\n\nThird, they remember application pairings through this tiling. If you move to another app, another virtual desktop, or just disconnect your laptop from your external monitor, your application pairings and tiling will be kept, and you can return to them just by using the task bar.\n\nI think this implementation makes sense for regular users. The average computer user doesn't use the keyboard to interact with their windows, they use the mouse.\n\nNow in terms of Gaming, Windows still has the advantage over Linux. Proton is a game changer, pun totally intended, but it still can't run everything, especially anything that uses anti cheat software.\n\nMicrosoft is widening the gap with Windows 11, with 2 main features.\nThe first one is DirectStorage. It's an API that lets games transfer the assets they need to load in, like textures, or complex 3D models, directly to the GPU, instead of using the CPU. \n\nThe second nice feature is the Auto HDR. This basically takes older games that haven't got any HDR support, and applies a few transformations to the color space so that they look a bit better than they used to and make use of a greater dynamic range. it's not going to be as nice as real-baked in HDR, but it still improves visual quality quite a bit on older titles.\n\nThis one seems feasible on Linux as well, as it's just a processing layer on top of the game itself, so we should be able to replicate it, if anyone has the required skills and time to tackle it of course.","viewCount":2772,"lengthSeconds":650,"watchProgress":0,"timeWatched":1625425599013,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"h8qjhrSsSr6iaptF"}

Sara Fajira) Official Music Video","author":"Weird Genius","authorId":"UCa_RUwqQU0oAxEI2lh4RvEQ","published":1585161000000,"description":"OUT NOW! Stream on digital stores worldwide.\nhttps://astralwerks.lnk.to/Lathi\n\nFOLLOW WEIRD GENIUS\nSPOTIFY: https://open.spotify.com/artist/5B4kCOhcqTywB9YwXPfFtJ\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/weird.genius/\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/WEIRDGENIUS_\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@weirdgeniusmusic  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReza Oktovian, Eka Gustiwana, Gerald Liu; the three now known as Weird Genius started making music together in year 2016. Each used to work on their own projects. Soon as the merge, they transmit everything they excel at into this collaborative venture. They draw inspirations from everywhere; what is coming out of love to life, social to gaming. The group self-describe their music as hard, upbeat, pumping, crazy-drop. This sound style is something they consciously develop since the beginning.\n\nLaunching the first digital single in 2020, Weird Genius joins singer and rapper from Surabaya, Sara Fajira. The latest single titled 'LATHI' is available via download and streaming on all digital music platforms starting February 28, 2020.\n\nStaying on the electronic dance music track, they played a pumping beat entry that could not be separated from the main characteristic of Weird Genius, which is to combine traditional elements in every music. This time the Javanese culture was very thick even from the first note of the song to the end, plus a bridge using Javanese lyrics that was sung with the style of sinden by Sara.\n\n\"The producing & recording process is quite fast, approximately one month. The lyrics are inspired by personal experiences that many couples might have experienced and were written by Weird Genius with Sara Fajira. Musically, we balance EDM and modern English with traditional culture from Javanese instruments and lyrics, \"explained Weird Genius.\n\nThe lyrics of this English song speak of a love relationship full of lies and egos that 'says' love but only hurts. Despite emphasising the dark side of the relationship, upbeat music and honest lyrics bring the implied meaning of courage and a strong stand in the face of 'a toxic relationship'. Described in a piece of Javanese lyrics \"Kowe ra iso mlayu saka kesalahan. Ajining diri ana ing lathi\", meaning \"You cannot run away from mistakes. A person's self-esteem is on the tongue (words)\", taken from the old Javanese proverb \"Ajining soko lathi, ajining rogo soko busono.\"\n\n\nMV Credits:\n\nDirector: Reza Oktovian & Creamypandaxx\nEditor: Creamypandaxx & Reza Oktovian \nDOP: Taufik Akbar\nVisual Fx: Yaanaako\nAss.

Get ready for HER - great stories about stepping up, health, depression, dating, beauty and marriage filled with twists, turns and feeling.\n\n01:25 - My Own Kind Of Beauty\nFrom beauty contests to cosmetic surgery, magazines to TV shows: the obsession with women’s beauty is ubiquitous. Images of ideal beauty surround us daily. But what does it actually mean to be “beautiful”? And who sets the standards? HER shows three very personal and very different approaches to what makes a woman beautiful. \n\n15:56 - Body and Mind\nThey take care of their families, their households and often maintain jobs simultaneously. That’s why many women forget that they also need to take care of their own health and wellbeing. Asia offers traditions dating back thousands of years, such as yoga or traditional Chinese medicine. In this HER episode, three women share their path to happiness through health and nutrition.\n\nDW presents: HER\nIn recent years important steps have been taken to strengthen women’s position in South and South East Asian societies dependent on the extent of their economic development.\n \nReforms of basic rights and legal systems, demographic changes and more dynamic civil societies have made this transformation possible. Despite all progress enormous challenges in various parts of Asia still lie ahead especially concerning gender equality.   \n\nWith this in mind the focus of our multimedia approach is on the lives of  women from India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Taiwan. We show their experiences with stepping up, health, depression, dating, marriage and beauty.\n\nEach episode focuses on one topic featuring three women from different countries and different backgrounds. The topics are universal and controversial.   \n\nFinding Mr. Right and the meaning of marriage / HER (1/3): https://youtu.be/4_Ct8VsYnPM\nBeauty, body and mind / HER (2/3): https://youtu.be/CCtJ4Ta_1-c\nHER (3/3): Online July 10\n\n#DWHer #documentary #women #Asia\n__\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

What are their stories? How do they combine traditional and modern life? And how do they deal with marginalization and threats?\n\n\"There is an everyday Jewish life in Europe that rarely gets shown. Debates about politics, the Middle East and anti-Semitism overshadow the diversity of Jewish life. That's why it was important for us to be able to capture it, just by spontaneously going there and seeing what was happening.\" This was the mission statement that led Swiss writer Yves Kugelmann and German film producer Alice Brauner, both Jewish, on a journey across Europe.\n\nThe first part of this two-part documentary takes Brauner and Kugelmann to Marseille, Strasbourg, Frankfurt and Berlin. They talk about life in the Jewish quarter with Harold Weill, Chief Rabbi of Strasbourg, and ask whether he and his community feel threatened. Alon Meyer, chairman of intercultural soccer club Makkabi Frankfurt and president of the Jewish sports organization Makkabi Germany, describes the hostility his team faces away from the field. In Berlin, Brauner and Kugelmann meet the writer and dramatist Sasha Marianna Salzmann.\n\n#documentary #Jewish #Europe\n\n__\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This is Khewra Salt Mine and it's located in Jhelum District, Punjab. Today it's a major tourist attraction drawing up to 250,000 visitors a year.\n\nThe mine is famous for its production of pink Khewra salt, often marketed as Himalayan salt, and is a major tourist attraction. The mine is also known as Mayo Salt Mine.\n\nEntry prices are Adult Rs. 400, Students/Children/Seniors Rs. 200, Foreigners $20 USD, train charges Rs 200.\n\nIts history dates back to its discovery by Alexander's troops in 320 BC, but it started trading in the Mughal era.\n\nThe main tunnel at ground level was developed by Dr. H. Warth, a mining engineer, in 1872 during British rule.\n\nThe mine remains the largest source of salt in Pakistan, producing more than 350,000 tons per annum of about 99% pure halite. Estimates of the reserves of salt in the mine vary from 82 million tons to 600 million tons.\n\nYou can read more about Khewra Salt Mines in the article \"Khewra mines: A salt wonder for tourists\" https://www.dawn.com/news/1507289.\n\n00:00 Going into the second largest salt mine in the world\n1:14 Train ride into Khewra Salt Mine\n2:10 A Mosque built of salt\n03:16 Exploring the salt caves\n05:57 Ticket prices & power cut\n07:16 Getting out of the mines\n\n👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇\n\n1) SUBSCRIBE! ✔ Click\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/KarlRock/?sub_confirmation=1\nThen smash the BELL ICON so you don't miss a 🔴live stream or video.\n\n2) SUPPORT THE CONTENT I CREATE & GET SPECIAL BENEFITS 🙏🏻❤️\nPress the blue JOIN button or https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtfXgNnA-QcxjHJjk5wXLFg/join.\n\n3) WANT TO LEARN HINDI हिन्दी?\nLearn Hindi Faster Than I Did! eBook at https://karlrock.com.\n\n4) LET'S CONNECT 👋🏻\nhttps://www.instagram.com/iamkarlrock/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/iamkarlrock\nhttps://twitter.com/iamkarlrock\n\n#Pakistan #Travel #Salt #Mine #KarlRock #Pakistani #Khewra #SaltMine #Food #Jhelum #Punjab #PakistanTravel #Mining #Tourism #Himalayan","viewCount":11061,"lengthSeconds":515,"watchProgress":514.089794,"timeWatched":1625647505990,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"yIotNGgguUrzpcbL"}

But wait a minute, Apple might be very present in the US, but in the rest of the world, Macs just aren't all that common. \n\nAccording to StatCounter, Windows still holds 73.5% of the market, with Mac OS commanding 15.87%. That's small, but it's still a lot higher than Linux on the desktop, which only holds 2.38% marketshare.\n\nSo, obviously, as a developer, if you look at these numbers, you're going to invest time porting your app to the new Apple platform, and not to Linux.\n\nSecond reason is developer tools.\n\nApple is known for restricting what they allow on their platforms, but they also have very good developer tools. They have their own IDE, Xcode, their preferred programming languages, with Swift and Objective C, and they have tons and tons of online resources and documentation to help you get started.\n\nThere is no \"standardized starter kit\" on Linux that would give you a quick and easy starting point. You have to pick between the language you want to use, between GTK or Qt, or Clutter, or something else, and then find some tutorials and documentation by yourself, and get coding.\n\nApple has simple guides and checklists to help you look at what you need to take care of, when you start porting your app to their new architecture. it's a guided process, and you can keep using the tools you were already using: same language, same IDE, same compilation process.\n\nI think it all comes down to the process: on the Apple platform, you have a very straightforward path, you're guided every step of the way. You're more limited, and you have to pay to distribute, I think it's 99$ per year to get access to the developer tools, but at least you know where you're going.\n\nOn Linux, you have to make conscious choices along the way, every step of the way. It's a \"do it yourself\" process: you need to look for, and learn on your own, as there is no standardized development platform.\n\nThird reason? Application distribution.\n\nDistributing your app is crucial to ensure that people will find it, download it, try it, use it, and maybe pay for it. Apple has that pretty much in the bag.\n\nThe Mac App Store might not have everything that you can install on your mac, but it's still another standardized process. You have an online developer console, where you upload your app, enter the details, submit it for review, make changes, upload updates, whatever.\n\nIf the mac app store rejects you, or if their limitations don't fit your app, you can still distribute it through your own website, you only have 1 binary to provide. Macs only have 1 packaging format, all applications are .app, which is basically a folder containing the executable and its required libraries, basically like an AppImage.\n\nOn Linux, distributing your app is a LOT more convoluted.\n\nFirst, you need to have packages separated for each architecture: x86 or ARM for example. That's 2 compilation to do, 2 packages to maintain.\n\nSecond, you'll have to choose the packaging format. If you only do a .deb, your app won't work on Fedora, Red Hat, openSUSE, or Arch based distros.\nIf you do an RPM, you lock yourself out of Debian, and all ubuntu based distros.\n\nYou could do a flatpak, or a snap, but not all distros use these, even though Flatpak is virtually everywhere now, and some users don't like these packaging formats and won't use them.\n\nThen there is the fact that only ONE app store on Linux lets you ask for money for your app, that's the elementary AppCenter. Anywhere else, you can't charge users for downloading the app, so you have to implement some kind of licence key system, or subscription system, that you have to handle all on your own","viewCount":11007,"lengthSeconds":677,"watchProgress":640.78288,"timeWatched":1625900850485,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"zR6kLkKBTscEaRTJ"}
